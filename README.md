# Mask-Detection
Mask Detection System implemented using ResNet and OpenCV

Dataset was obtained from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/vtech6/medical-masks-dataset 

Credits to Mr Dohun Kim's notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/dohunkim/visualizing-medical-mask-dataset) which helped with retrieving faces and labeling them.
